title: Personal development plan

At the beginning of last semester I made a Personal Development plan, you can take a look at it here:

Here is the link to my Professional Identity & Vision assessment:

In this PDP I had set five learning goals for the upcoming semester.
Those five goals were:
Improving my skills in designing and making electronics
Getting more familiar with CAD programs
Improving my pitching skills
Improve reflective writing
Improve planning skills

Through the course Creative Electronics I got the chance to learn a lot more about electronics circuits and expand my practical experience in working with them. I went from only being able to solder two wires together, to being able to solder an entire through hole circuit. I also learned a lot more about the functionality of analog circuits and how to make my own analog circuits.
In the course Creative Mechanical Engineering I got to work a lot with Solidworks. And when I say a lot, I really do mean a lot. The only way you can really learn all the finesses of Solidworks is with time and patience. So feel free to take a look at my homepage for photos of the final result.
With Design Project one I got the chance to work on my pitching and planning skills. Through the two demo days I got to practice my pitching and preparation skills. In a project itself are a lot of deadlines, so good planning is key. I tried several techniques and approaches to it. I discovered which of those techniques suit me better. I thinks the biggest aspect of planning I learned is that it is not a good idea to plan everything on an hourly basis. Maintaining such a planning causes way too much stress and energy, which you could have spent on actual work.
And last but not least, reflective writing. For almost each course I followed last year I had to write a reflection of some sort. The main thing I struggled with in reflecting was the whole concept of reflective learning. If you don’t set learning goals and expectations on what you want to achieve trough a certain activity, it becomes really hard to reflect on your learning, because you have no reference to reflect on. But through setting goals and expectations for everything I wanted to learn, I gets a lot easier for me to actually start writing something which makes sense.

I think I learned a lot last year and I really think I grew a lot as an individual person. But there’s always room for improvement, or to try something completely different.
Next year I want to take my electronics skills even a step further. Together with my experience in Solidworks I want to create a fully functioning electronic gadget. I have a couple of ideas in mind on which I want to work upcoming summer holidays. I will post more updates on my blog on this website soon.
Next year I want to continue to improve my professional skills. Next year I will become a board member of the student sport association Avalanche Boarders. I will either become Chairman or Commissary Public Relations, so I will get to improve my planning skills in a more real life sense, but I also my communication and teamwork.
