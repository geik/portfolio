Nature is one of the most inspiring things in this world. To see how it adapts to different environments is something of which we can learn a lot. Take a tree for example. No matter what is built around it, it always finds a way around that what is built or even right through it. But this doesn’t have to be the case. In my ideal world, technology and nature don’t work against each other, but they work hand in hand.
Operating should go without a hassle. Though the aesthetic should not be compromised in any way. When something functions properly and is easy to use, but it is a pain to look at, who would want to show that something to the public? I want to find a balance between aesthetics and functionality, without compromising much on both of them. They are equally important.
