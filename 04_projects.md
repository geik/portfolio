Design Project One â€“ Stream
Walking through the tunnels in Eindhoven is often a negative experience. With Stream, we want to make walking, or cycling, through these tunnels more inviting, by making the atmosphere safer. We explored how light and sound can influence a persons mood or mental state. We also looked at things that people find calming, and decided to mainly take inspiration from nature.

A projection of a friendly turtle will guide you through the tunnel that is decorated with leaf like lights on the wall. These references to nature have a calming effect. There are also soothing sound effects, that give the tunnel a more mellow atmosphere, reducing stress levels.

To present our concept at the demo day we have created an interactive virtual reality experience.
It uses a Google Cardboard viewer, so if you have one laying around feel free to try out the app!
You can download the installation file for the app here
The app only works for Android 4.4 or higher!

In app controls:
Move forward by pressing your touchscreen
You can change your walking direction by turning your head
