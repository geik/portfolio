This first year at Industrial Design has been a long year. I took my first steps into the life an adult, like moving out of my parents’ home. I have gained an incredible amount of knowledge  through my study already, and this is only my first year. So I want to summarize what I want to do and learn next year.

I really want to improve my sketching skills next year, so I will follow the course Exploratory Sketching in the first quartile of the next academic year.
I want to take my electronics skills to the next level, so I will apply the knowledge I already have into making prototypes for my upcoming projects and for hobby projects. I also want to continue to use Solidworks to make build schematics for future prototypes and projects.
In upcoming projects I also want to keep improving my knowledge of analog and digital circuitry in all the electronics that will needs to produced.
For Business and Entrepreneurship, which is my least developed Expertise Area, I will follow the USE Trajectory Technology Entrepreneurship. I really want to gain more knowledge on this topic, since it is an important part of the design process. You can have a fantastic well developed and realized product, but if you can’t sell it or use it, it could be a real waste of time.
I find the interaction between users and products particularly interesting. What feelings does the product evoke in a user? But also, how does the product interact with other products? These are my preferences for the project squads I want to participate in next semester: Connecting Rich Interaction and Growing System, Crafting Everyday Soft Things and Seamless Interaction Design for Everyday Life. Through one of these projects I want to satisfy this fascination for this interaction.
I also want to continue to improve my professional skills. I will become a board member of the student sport association [Avalanche Boarders](https://avalancheboarders.nl/){:target="_blank"}. Through this I hope to gain more hands-on experience with the various professional skills.
