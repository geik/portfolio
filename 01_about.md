  Hey there!
</p>

The best way I could describe myself would be as a “thinkerer”, a coalescence of the words thinker and tinkerer. I am very much a tinkerer. I like to tinker with new tools and mechanisms to get a good feeling of what exactly makes them tick and what you can do with them. I am very much a thinker in the way that I like think of new ways to use or exploit those new tools and mechanisms.  
  
In groups, I like to take on the role of the monitor. I analyze matters independently and critically. I like to look at matters from a very objective point of view and make decisions based on what is true and well thought out, not based on what feels right. A lot of the time I also take on the role of the specialist in groups. Since I am quite proficient in electronics and programming, I almost always get assigned to task within that field. I really don’t mind it though, since I get to tinker a lot when working with electronics and programming.
